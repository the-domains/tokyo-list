> I have been working on this list for the past few years. What started as a little R&D for a friend coming to Tokyo, turned into an email between friends :) and eventually that same email was shared so much it returned to my inbox as a Carbon Copy. Which didn't strike me as that weird, but it got me thinking. So I thought some more and (3 years of thinking later...) decided to evolve it into more than just an email between friends. It's now what I like to call a fluid project and luckily

# it's an accidentally fun list!

> Tokyo is fun by default! so go experience these places and get some FUN.The source of the list is related to my 15 years of learnings within the Food, Beverage, Music, Creative and Fashion fields of Tokyo. The list has 'bonus' sub-lists related to exercise (cycling, running, yoga etc.) and some pretty obvious touristy stuff (very pretty).
